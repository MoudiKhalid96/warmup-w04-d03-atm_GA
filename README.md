# Make an ATM 

For this warmup you will be creating an ATM class.



It will have the following properties...
* `type` (e.g., "checking"), which should be determined by some input
* `money`, which should start out as `0`

It should have the following methods...
* `withdraw`, which should decrease the amount of money by some input
* `deposit`, which should increase the amount of money by some input
* `showBalance`, which should print the amount of money in the bank to the console.



### Bonus
The `Atm` class has a `transactionHistory` property which keeps track of the withdrawals and deposits made to the account.

- Make sure to indicate whether the transaction increased or decreased the amount of money in the bank.
